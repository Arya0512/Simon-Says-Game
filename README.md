This project is a simple Simon Says game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the classic memory game where players are required to repeat a sequence of colors that are shown to them. The game increases in difficulty as the sequence gets longer with each successful round.

# Game Rules
The game will randomly generate a sequence of colors.
The player must repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the same order.
If the player correctly repeats the sequence, a new color is added to the sequence.
If the player makes a mistake, the game will end and the score will be displayed.
The game continues until the player loses.
